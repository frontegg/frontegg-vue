### 🚀 Major Changes
- **Store Management:**  
  Replaced the existing Redux store with Valtio. This change significantly reduces the bundle size, removes the boilerplate code associated with generator functions, and enables actions to be `async/await`. The new approach provides better stack traces and allows actions to be awaited directly, eliminating the need for callback functions.

### 🔧 Upgrades
- **TypeScript:**  
  Upgraded TypeScript from version `v3.9.7` to `v5.5.4`. This update ensures compatibility with the latest TypeScript features and improves overall type-checking and developer experience.

- **Testing Framework:**  
  Upgraded Jest to version `v29`. This upgrade includes performance improvements, new features, and bug fixes, ensuring more reliable and faster tests.

- **UI Dependencies:**  
  Upgraded Material UI, Emotion, and Stylis to their latest versions, enhancing UI component performance, styling flexibility, and overall user experience.

- **Node.js:**  
  Upgraded Node.js from version `16` to `18.18`, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and security updates.

### 🛠 Enhancements
- **Refactor:**  
  Refactored code to use nested imports in Material UI, which helps reduce bundle size.

- **Dependencies:**  
  Incremented various dependencies, Node.js, and TypeScript to align with the latest standards and ensure better performance and security.

- **New Feature:**  
  Added a "Resend Invitation Email" action to the users table on the "All Accounts" page, improving user management capabilities.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Permissions & Privacy Page:**  
  Removed permissions from the privacy page. The user privacy page will now be displayed for all users in the admin portal.
